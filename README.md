### dotfiles repository

This is a collection of my personal dotfiles, which I use to configure my development
environment. Furthermore, I included a script and brew file to install the most common
tools.

#### installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thibsy/dotfiles.git "$(pwd)/.dotfiles"
sh "$(pwd)/.dotfiles/install.sh"
```
